At the University of Tehran, my team and I developed a **cryptocurrency** as a proof of concept using pure Python, introducing a unique **Proof of Activity** as its main **consensus protocol**. This innovative protocol was crafted to amalgamate the advantages of both the PoS and PoA protocols. Our approach was informed by extensive research, including numerous papers and courses, and the study has been successfully concluded.
