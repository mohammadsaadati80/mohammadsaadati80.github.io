Driven by a passion for transforming education using cutting-edge technology, we've spearheaded research into **artificial intelligence**, particularly reinforcement learning, to create tailored adaptive learning systems for students. Complementing this, we harness the potential of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, employing techniques such as fine-tuning and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, to produce bespoke educational content. Further enhancing our endeavor, we've introduced a novel pedagogy model for Deep Learning and designed a state-of-the-art **Learning Management System (LMS)**. This LMS, developed with Python, Django, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, integrates an optimized **ChatGPT** with **Google Classroom**, leveraging AI tools like Discord and AI-based robots to offer a rich, personalized learning landscape. Our combined efforts aim for an engaging, accessible, and truly inclusive educational future, details of which can be found on our [website](https://aiedut.com/).
