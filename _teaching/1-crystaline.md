Crystalline, a cryptocurrency developed in pure Python as a proof of concept, was crafted by me and several students at the University of Tehran. Designed as a peer-to-peer network for file storage, it employs a unique Proof of Activity consensus protocol, blending proof-of-Activity with proof-of-work mining. While it shares intentions with filecoin, Crystalline introduces numerous innovations in the cryptocurrency realm, from its security model to its Activity-based mechanisms. However, this repository is for conceptual purposes and not intended for production use.
