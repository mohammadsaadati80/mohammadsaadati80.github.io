At the University of Tehran, my team and I developed a cryptocurrency as a proof of concept using pure Python, introducing a unique Proof of Activity as its main consensus protocol. This innovative protocol was crafted to amalgamate the advantages of both the PoS and PoA protocols. Our approach was informed by extensive research, including numerous papers and courses, and the study has been successfully concluded.
