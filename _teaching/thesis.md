In my bachelor's thesis, I explore **Transfer Learning** approaches, emphasizing the application of knowledge across domains with distinct action spaces. While some research has addressed transfer learning with varying dynamics and reward functions, there remains a gap in understanding transfers between differing action spaces. Simultaneously, I address the challenge of **reinforcement learning**'s limited **generalization** across diverse environments. Integrating the inherent sequential structure of reinforcement learning into our representation process, I aim to leverage prior knowledge more effectively. This research presents an innovative approach to current tasks compared to traditional methods by combining Transfer Learning and Reinforcement Learning and exploring the potential of **Large Language Models**.
