For my bachelor's thesis, I am delving into **Transfer Learning** approaches, focusing on enabling agents to apply knowledge from domains with distinct action spaces. While some exploration has been done on transfer learning with varying dynamics and reward functions, there's a gap in understanding transfers between differing action spaces. Concurrently, I'm tackling the challenge of reinforcement learning's limited **generalization** across diverse environments. By integrating the inherent sequential structure of reinforcement learning into our representation process, I aim to leverage prior knowledge more effectively, presenting an innovative approach to current tasks compared to traditional methods.
