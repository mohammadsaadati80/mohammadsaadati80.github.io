In my bachelor’s thesis, I explored the application of **Transfer Learning** to improve the efficiency of **Reinforcement Learning**, with a particular focus on utilizing **large language models**. Reinforcement Learning often faces challenges, such as extended learning times and difficulty adapting to new problems. My research aimed to address these challenges by using Transfer Learning to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from past experiences to new tasks. By leveraging large language models, I investigated how identifying similarities and differences between previous knowledge and new problems can enhance learning efficiency. The experiments demonstrated that large language models can significantly accelerate learning and improve decision-making, presenting a more efficient approach than traditional Reinforcement Learning techniques.
